Cross-Compilation using Mingw-w64

FreeRDP can be compiled for Windows (32/64 Bit) on a Linux system using the Mingw cross-compilers. The following instruction was tested with Mingw-w64 2.0 and gcc-4.7 on Scientific Linux 6.1 (x64) but should work relatively independent of the Mingw/gcc version.

1. Install the Mingw-cross compilers (most Linux distros offer binary packages for Mingw in their repos). On older distros you may need to compile the latest version of Mingw from source. If you want to create 32 Bit binaries only, then Mingw32 is sufficient, otherwise you should install Mingw-w64.

2. Download the latest version of openssl (http://www.openssl.org/), compile it using the Mingw cross-compilers and install it. Instructions how to do this can be found on http://www.blogcompiler.com/.

3. Download FreeRDP and unpack the source archive. Create a subdirectory in the FreeRDP source tree called “mingw_build” where FreeRDP will be build. Open a terminal and goto this directory. Enter the command

cmake -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME="Windows" \
      -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER="/opt/mingw64/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc" \
      -DCMAKE_RC_COMPILER="/opt/mingw64/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-windres" \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/opt/mingw64" \
      -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF \
      -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-DFREERDP_EXPORTS -Dsprintf_s=snprintf" \
      -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="-L/opt/mingw64/lib" \
      -DWITH_SSE2=OFF \
      -DWITH_SSE2_TARGET=OFF \
      -DOPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR="/opt/mingw64/include" \
      -DLIB_EAY="/opt/mingw64/lib/libcrypto.a" \
      -DSSL_EAY="/opt/mingw64/lib/libssl.a" \
      ..
This will configure FreeRDP for cross-compilation. Note that you need to adjust the paths according to your installation of Mingw and OpenSSL. Using the command above the wfreerdp.exe binary will be statically linked and can be executed on any Windows machine.
