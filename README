Windows RDS: Run Windows Software on Linux By VM But seem like direct
======================================================================

are you like me love linux but some Applications what you need run only on Windows like Photoshop and Evernote and etc.... and wine for you is impractical

may be you want to try this solution 

1) Install Windows On VM by VirtualBox or VMWare or any Virtualization Solution and install all your windwos Applications 

2) in this Windows VM Install RemoteApp Tool 5300 from tools folder and add your Windows Applications as Remote Desktop Service

3) In your linux machine install FreeRDP http://www.freerdp.com/

4) you can make your windows VM run at startup and in background just google it

5) Complie and run Windows_RDS and connect to Windows VM with IP Address


==========================================================================

you can add windows application with your prefered icon and start it directlly from linux 

you can add windwos shared folder and run it directlly by dolphin file manager
